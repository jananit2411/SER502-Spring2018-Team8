2. Executable is available in Stark/executable folder
3. Sample programs are available in Stark/data/stark_programs folder
4. Intermediate Code for those programs are available under Stark/data/intermediate_code folder
5. Presentation is under main folder
6. The YouTube video link for demo is here


Tools Used :
ANTLR 4
